      details:"At Mahindra Happinest, our purpose is creating the happiest laces to grow. This is not just a promise to our customers, it is a promise to our partners as well. Loyalie, with its digital engagement platforms for customers and channel partners, was a perfect fit to further our purpose. I find Akhil and his team to be true thought-partners who are able to bring to bear their intimate understanding of the real estate value chain to help us together conceive and create solutions that are both pioneering and value-creating for our partners and for us. The best proof point for this is the high levels of usage and engagement with the HappiEdge app we launched for our channel partners in December 2019. Encouraged by the response we received, we are already working on the next feature set.",
